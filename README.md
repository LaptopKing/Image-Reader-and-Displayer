# Image-Reader-and-Displayer
## Basic disclaimer

This is a terminal based image viewer which you can use to intercept images on a headless server, like ubuntu server or something like that. It is finished, probably won't get any new features because it displays images very nicely.

## Note

Very high resolution images could crash the program, and even could lead to computer shutdown, so please be aware of that.
